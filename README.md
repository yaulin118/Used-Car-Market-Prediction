About Used Cars Data
Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale. The data provider built a scraper for a school project and expanded upon it later to create this dataset which includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on Craigslist.

Inspiration
Buyers paid 12.2% more for new vehicles in January 2022 than in January 2021, and the picture was even worse for used vehicles, which were up more than 40 percent year over year. COVID-19, the resulting chip shortage, and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine are all parts of the problem. Those may end, but expect the car-buying experience to be permanently changed.

Right now, most shoppers are paying a premium for their cars compare to the year before. According to the analysis, the average used car price rose to $33,464 in February, which is about 1% higher than January. While prices may come down some as the year goes on, the used car market will still face high demand.

As the result, it got me inspired to working on this dataset that I found on Kaggle. I hope we can find out some interesting facts
